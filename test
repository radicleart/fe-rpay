The deliverables of my tenure in the Clarity Lab Residency will be;

collation and documentation of best practices and design principals around Clarity smart contract development

innovative, annotated clarity contracts, complete with Clarinet test suits, published in open source github repo which demonstrate novel structures and properties of the Clarity smart contract language.

a unique clarity integration (oracle, bridge, atomic swap etc)

act as a point of contact on the big issues - evolution of the DAO on stacks, upgrade paths for Clarity contracts, security concerns of atomic swap implementations

work with other members of the foundation to publish findings, design guidelines, recommendations to relevant web portals

be a point of contact and feedback to projects and the clarity dev community to express and share concerns and ideas, design patterns and anti-patterns and interesting integrations
